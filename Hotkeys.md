# Reactor Hotkeys

Reactor supports the use of the following hotkeys:

- Select all atoms in List panel (Control/Command + A)
- Remove selected atom package in List panel (Delete/Backspace)
- Refresh List panel (Control/Command + R)
- Open Console window (Shift + 0)
- Open Preferences window (Control/Command + ,)
- Open Atomz List File (Control/Command + O)
- Save Atomz List File (Control/Command + S)

## Drag and Drop Handling

In addition to using hotkeys, you can also use drag & drop approaches to drag an Atoms list file (.lst) document from your desktop folder onto the Reactor icon. Reactor will then offer to install the list of favorite packages. This makes it quick to sync the same atoms between local and remote computers.
