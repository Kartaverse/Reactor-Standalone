# Reactor Standalone for Resolve/Fusion

Reactor 4 Beta Build 27 - 2025-09-22  

## Overview

Reactor is a package manager created by the [We Suck Less Community](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewforum.php?f=32) for Fusion and Resolve. Reactor streamlines the installation of 3rd party content through the use of "Atom" packages that are synced automatically with a Git repository.

The Reactor Package Manager has been revamped as a desktop application that works seamlessly on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
