One of the new additions arriving with Reactor Standalone v4 is the creation of a GitLab hosted Houdini atom package repository:

This is part of an effort to support SideFX Houdini content installation using atom packages. The Houdini compatible material is downloaded by Reactor Standalone and saved to the folder:

```
Reactor:/DeployHoudini/
```
